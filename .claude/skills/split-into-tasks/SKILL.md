description: Split an implementation-ready spec into the fewest independently deliverable vertical tasks and select only risk-justified intermediate review checkpoints. Use when a spec has multiple outcomes needing separate delivery or dependency tracking; keep one coherent outcome as the spec itself.

# Split Into Tasks

## Read the spec

Require `docs/specs/<slug>/spec.md`; if it is missing, stop before proposing
tasks.

Read the spec and current code, plus relevant project decisions, glossary terms,
and an approved prototype when present. Treat missing implementation as the
target gap. Pause on conflicting settled sources and present the exact decision
to resolve. When the approved behavior forms one coherent user workflow, keep
the spec as the sole handoff; separate operations or states inside that workflow
do not create task boundaries.

## Propose the complete outcome map

For work with multiple independently deliverable outcomes, draft the complete
shallow map using the fewest independently usable and verifiable outcomes. Fold
prerequisite work into the first outcome that makes it useful unless that work
is independently deliverable. Declare only blockers that genuinely prevent a
dependent outcome.

Cover every spec outcome. For each proposed task show its title, delivered
behavior, observable acceptance criteria, focused deterministic verification,
task-specific constraints, blockers with reasons, and any review checkpoint.
Implementation derives the active outcome's technical approach just in time
from the then-current repository, so omit predicted files, functions, code
structure, technical-layer steps, context boundaries, and internal sequences.
Under a task's constraints record only the references scoped to that task: the
approved prototype screens and states it delivers, and a decision contract only
it depends on. Name what each governs and leave its rules and screen
compositions in the source itself.

Add an intermediate review checkpoint only when a material error could compound
through substantial dependent work, or when deterministic checks cannot
adequately settle a material risk such as security, data, permission, migration,
recovery, or an external contract. Name its cumulative scope and concrete risk.
A checkpoint buys one review pass over that scope, not a round that repeats
until it reports nothing. The implementation phase owns the single final review
over the whole diff.

Present the complete proposal and iterate until the user approves it. Write no
task files before that approval.

## Write the approved handoff

After approval, record shared settled constraints in the spec and only
task-specific constraints in task files. Do not invent unsettled behavior.

Write each approved task to
`docs/specs/<slug>/tasks/<NN>-<slug>.md` using
[`templates/task.md`](templates/task.md), with blockers before dependents.
For an approved revision, remove replaced tasks that have never recorded
completion. Preserve a task with recorded completion history even if it later
returned to `in-progress` or `blocked`; after its still-required obligations and
blocker references move to the approved replacement, set it to `superseded` and
append revision evidence naming the replacement and reason. A `superseded` task
is terminal for that approved breakdown and is inactive recovery history, not
part of the current delivery map. Do not create an archive. End after writing
the current task handoff, before implementation.
