# Shape Idea

## Keep alignment separate from delivery

Shaping settles decisions; implementation applies them. Do not change product
source, configuration, or dependencies, even for an edit you plan to revert. A
changed line mixes alignment with delivery and leaves unreviewed code behind.

Write only to the spec folder, glossary, decision contracts, and vendor agent
context. Run every experiment, benchmark, and preview in a scratch directory
outside the working tree. If no experiment can answer a question, record an
assumption and its risk. If code contradicts the user or a decision, surface the
conflict; do not fix the code.

Check the working tree when you start and again before writing `spec.md`.
Revert what this session changed outside the allowed paths and keep only what
you learned. Leave uncommitted work that predates the session alone.

## Ground decisions in project truth

Before the first question, invoke `project-knowledge` and apply it throughout the
session. If it is unavailable, read `GLOSSARY.md` and relevant subjects from
`docs/decisions/README.md` when present, update confirmed terms, and surface
terminology or decision conflicts for explicit clarification.

Read root `PRODUCT.md` when it exists before settling the work unit. Treat it as
the current app-level premise, use only the product constraints relevant to the
selected work, and surface any mismatch that would require changing that
premise. Do not create, edit, or copy the whole file into the work-unit spec.
Missing `PRODUCT.md` does not block shaping.

Resolve what available evidence can answer before asking the user.

Ground any conclusion about a third-party package or tool in evidence of how it
actually behaves — its own source, documentation, releases, and maintainer
statements — and confirm it against this project's versions in a scratch copy
before building on it or working around it. Record what was checked, what fell
short, and the upstream change that would reopen the decision.

When a decision selects a framework or hosted service, invoke
`add-stack-context` when available and let it own discovery, source acceptance,
installation, live vendor-document routing, and accounting. When it is absent,
retain the selected technology's outcome inline: use `find-skills` when
available, or an equivalent current Skills search when not, verify vendor
control before installing an official skill, require explicit approval for a
community skill, and check other official vendor channels. Keep a changing
`llms.txt` at its official source and preserve a bounded `AGENTS.md` or
`CLAUDE.md` instruction that retrieves it during relevant work instead of
copying its contents into the repository. Account for the selected technology
before continuing.

## Present one decision at a time

Present a concrete candidate for the user to correct, using the lightest medium
that makes the decision judgeable.

- Decide an inexpensive, reversible choice when a mismatch is unlikely or easy
  to detect; state it as an overridable assumption, never a project decision
  contract.
- For a branch expensive to get wrong, ask exactly one question about one fact,
  value, or choice. Include a recommended answer and concise reason, then wait.
- If a proposed decision depends on information only the user can know, state
  that information and ask whether it applies. Verify any condition you can
  check yourself.
- For a choice judged by looking or trying, inspect the current surface as
  evidence and show it only when the decision requires a baseline comparison.
  Render a candidate or two or three controlled variants, verify the relevant
  states, and wait for the user's reaction. Invoke `build-prototype` for a
  whole-surface review or a temporary comparison for the user's specific
  situation. Scope that decision layer independently of product screen count:
  pass only the question and context needed to judge it, integrate
  the chosen result into the existing prototype when present, discard the
  comparison, and resume shaping. If no sufficient renderer is available, defer
  the decision and record the resulting risk.
- When a flow, state model, or relationship has multiple branches, transitions,
  or links, render one diagram before a downstream decision. Ask at most one
  question about its unresolved part and wait. Keep a linear structure that fits
  in one sentence in prose.
- When the user asks for an explanation rather than a decision, invoke
  `explain-visually`. If unavailable, use one sentence when sufficient or the
  best available renderer otherwise.

A choice is settled when the user confirms it or it is made under authority the
user explicitly delegated for that class of decision. It becomes a project
decision contract only when future work should reuse it, its rationale prevents
reasonable re-litigation, and it came from a real trade-off; feature-local
choices stay in the spec.

Skip review only for an already confirmed pattern, routine presentation details,
or explicit user delegation. Record the reason and treat only agent-judged
reasons as assumptions.

## Write the product contract

Stop asking questions when every implementation-relevant decision is resolved
or explicitly deferred; do not wait for the user to declare completion.
Translate confirmed product-change requests into required behavior. Keep cheap
agent-chosen defaults as overridable assumptions; ask about or explicitly defer
consequential unsettled behavior and record its possible impact as a remaining
risk. Never record a deferred branch as a settled constraint. Interim behavior
the product needs while it stays open is written under the deferred point,
naming the decision that replaces it; where the contract states that behavior
again so it can be built and tested, mark it interim there too.

When ready for implementation, write `docs/specs/<slug>/spec.md` as the stable
product contract, creating the kebab-case folder when needed. Include the
user-visible outcomes, approved scope, observable acceptance criteria, settled
constraints and rationale, assumptions, off-limits areas and why, deferred
points, and remaining risks. Record behavior and decisions without predicting
files, functions, code structure, technical layers, or implementation steps.
Carry only applicable app-level constraints from `PRODUCT.md`; keep the file as
their canonical product context rather than duplicating its full contents.

Link the approved `prototype.html` when one exists and each decision contract
this work depends on, so implementation loads them as required sources instead
of judging them optional. Preserve a link an earlier `build-prototype` close-out
already wrote. Say what each linked source governs here, and leave its own
rules, thresholds, and screen compositions in that source instead of copying
them back into a constraint the spec states; keep the links beside the
contract's fields rather than turning them into one.
Summarize the same contract and do not prompt for another action.
